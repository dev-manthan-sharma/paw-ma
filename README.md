**Generate Consistent, Domain-Specific Passwords**

Tired of juggling multiple unique passwords or reusing the same password everywhere? Paw-Ma helps you manage your online passwords effortlessly. Using a single Master Password, Paw-Ma generates a unique password for each domain, ensuring that you only need to remember one key password while maintaining a distinct login for every website.

## How It Works

### Single Master Password
- Use one master password to generate individual, consistent passwords for each website.

### Domain-Specific Generation
- Simply copy and paste the website's URL into Paw-Ma.
- The extension combines the domain with your master password to create a unique password specifically for that site.

### Account Differentiation
- For added flexibility, include an optional account differentiator such as your username or email.
- Paw-Ma integrates this account-specific detail with your master password (and the domain) to generate a unique password tailored to that particular account on the site.

### Local Password Generation
- All passwords are generated locally on your device.
- Your sensitive data never leaves your computer.

### Consistent Output
- Each time you use the same domain and master password, Paw-Ma produces the same generated password.
- No need to worry about which password goes with which website.
